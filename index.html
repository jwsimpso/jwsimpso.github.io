		Hi everyone. My name is Jeremy Simpson and I am from Durham North Carolina. For the last 16 years I have worked as a Tech Support Analyst at the University of North Carolina in the Psychiatry Department. I graduated with an Associates Degree from Durham Tech in Computer Networking in 2007 and from ECU in 2014 with a Bachelors in Business and Information Technology. In 2017 I enrolled in UNC's Coding BootCamp to improve my skills with software and web development.

		In my spare time I enjoy hanging out with my wife Jamie and our two daughters Avery (2) and Lucy (2mo). We also have 2 dogs. Beamer a Dachshund and Charlie a Pekignese. In my free time I enjoy watching college football and basketball, researching emerging technolgies and learning new skills. I have won several service awards at UNC including the 2007 UNC IT Award for an Individual which is a campus wide award for excellence in service. In addition to winning the award in 2007 I have been nominated as a finalist on 5 other occasions including 2016.
